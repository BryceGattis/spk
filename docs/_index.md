# SPK

A package management and software runtime.

Driven by the unique requirements of the visual effects industry, SPK has a few primary goals:

- Package Compatibility Beyond Version Numbers
- Recipe and Source Publication
- Fast, Dynamic Build and Runtime Environments
- Reliable and Natural Definition of Platforms and Constraints

More details on these goals can be found [here](/develop/design), or jump right into [getting started](/use).
