# spenv

## Development

For local development, some tests will require the privileged binaries to be built and have their capabilities set. You can rely on the system install of spenv for this in most cases, or run the `build.sh` script with sudo if you need to validate changes to the `spenv-mount` or `spenv-remount` binaries themselves.
