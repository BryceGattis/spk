version: 0.15.1
release_notes: |
  * Add --interactive/-i flag to build/make-binary cli commands
    * This flag sets up the build but creates an interactive shell instead
      of running the defined build script. This is helpful for debugging and quickly
      iterating on package builds
  * Fix bug that make some build artifacts get published into binary package
    * The pattern used to identify files to be purged did
       not match files in the root of the build area
