version: 0.16.0
release_notes: |
  * Update local sources to be less aggressive in file exclusions
    * Use configurable flags instead of the `--cvs-exclude` flag in rsync
    * This change should be backwards compatible with most existing specs but
      may cause additional files to be included in source packages which were not before
