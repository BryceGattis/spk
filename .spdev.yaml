version: 0.17.0
release_notes: |
  * Update solver to ignore packages that lack specifically requested options.
    For example, requesting `-o python.unicode=ucs4` will ingore any version
    of the python package that does not specify a `unicode` build option. This
    reduces errors where the user may have mispelles something or where older
    versions of a package may not include newly added build options. In either
    case it is more helpful to the developer to ensure that the option is used
    rather than to risk resolving a package with no opinion that may be incompatible.
