  ## Package Testing

  Adds `spk test` command and `tests` section to the package
  spec file which supports first class definition of tests
  for packages. Supports unit and integration-type testing
  as well as validation of source packages.

  ## Updates
  - Add --python-abi flag for pip package conversion

  ## Fixes
  - Fix bug where build spec could be seen as having duplicant variants even when that's not true
  - Fix bug where packages did not properly receive pinned inherited var
  - Allow variants to unclude options for dependencies and still be considered unique
