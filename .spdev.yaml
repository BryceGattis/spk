release_notes: |
  ## Realtime Output
  - Update solver debug output to stream in real-time for `spk env` and `spk explain`
    commands. This makes it much easier to debug long running resolves as usually the
    issue can be spotted in the first few attempts by the solver.

  ## Improvements
  - Update solver to not try and build packages from source when the result
    would be a binary package that already exists and is not applicable
